# Generic Terraform VPC module #

tf_vpc provides a VPC network that is distributed across 3 Availability Zones for high availability and segmented into dmz, app, data, and admin zones to provide isolation between system components.

## Local Development and Testing

Testing modules locally can be accomplished using a series of `Make` tasks
contained in this repo.

| Make Task | What happens                                                                                                  |
|:----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| all       | Execute the canonical build for the generic infrastructure module (does not destroy infra)                    |
| converge  | Execute `kitchen converge` for all modules                                                                    |
| circleci-build  | Run a local circleci build                                                                              |
| lint      | Execute `tflint` for generic infrastructure module                                                            |
| test      | Execute `kitchen test --destroy=always` for all modules                                                       |
| verify    | Execute `kitchen verify` for all modules                                                                      |
| destroy   | Execute `kitchen destroy` for all modules                                                                     |
| kitchen   | Execute `kitchen <command>`. Specify the command with the `COMMAND` argument to `make`                        |

e.g. run a single test: `make kitchen COMMAND="verify minimal-aws"`

**Typical Workflow:**

1. Start-off with a clean slate of running test infrastructure: `make destroy; make all`
2. Make changes and (repeatedly) run: `make converge && make verify`
3. Rebuild everything from scratch: `make destroy; make all`
4. Commit and issue pull request


## Running Test Kitchen for a single module

Test Kitchen uses the concept of "instances" as it's medium for multiple test 
packages in a project.
An "instance" is the combination of a _test suite_ and a _platform_.
This project uses a single _platform_ for all specs (e.g. `aws`).
The name of this platform actually doesn't matter since the terraform provisioner
and driver are not affected by it.

You can see the available test instances by running the `kitchen list` command:

```bash
$ make kitchen COMMAND=list
Instance     Driver     Provisioner  Verifier   Transport  Last Action  Last Error
default-aws  Terraform  Terraform    Terraform  Ssh        Verified
```

To run Test Kitchen processes for a single instance, you **must** use the `kitchen`
target from the make file and pass the command and the instance name using the
`COMMAND` variable to make.

```bash
# where 'default-aws is an Instance name from kitchen's list
$ make kitchen COMMAND="converge default-aws"
```
